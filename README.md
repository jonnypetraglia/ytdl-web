# ytdl-web

This is an extremely basic, extremely stupid web UI for youtube-dl and probably its forks.
This is meant to be run listening on your local LAN address, not exposed to the internet. Don't do it.

It's REALLY bad and I don't care. Not taking pull requests.

I guess the `YOUTUBE_DL_PATH` is the environment variable to change the path.
